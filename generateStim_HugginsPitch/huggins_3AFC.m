%% MATLAB code used to generate the stimuli with Huggins Pitch (HP)
% The code was initially written by Maria Chait (UCL)
% Edited and commented by Sijia Zhao (2020-07-12)

% Special note: When running this code, you will see a warning in the
% command window "Warning: Data clipped when writing file.". Ignore it,
% it's not a problem here.

% [SZ] Special note about sound format: By default the soundfile is saved in flac. 
% This formate is recommended as it has very good compression quality and
% relatively good browser compatibility (but not Internet Explorer or Opera).
% If you want better browser compatibility, please use mp3.
% OGG is not recommended, not only because it is not compatible with Safari
% but also because its compression quality is bad.
