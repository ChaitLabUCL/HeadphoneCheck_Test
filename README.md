# Web-based headphone Check with Huggins Pitch

This set of codes implements a online headphone check test using special noises. You can find more details about this test in our paper [add the link here]().



## Try it first!

This is just a demo. We don't save your data.

## Stimuli and task
[Explain the task based on the paper methods]

## How to use this
Before diving into this javascript code, check out our Gorilla version of this task, which you can use directly if you are planning to host your experiment on Gorilla [add the link here]().

### Alternative test: McDermott headphone test
In addition to the test based on detecting the huggins pitch, you may also try another headphone screening test developed by McDermott Lab (MIT).
[Try the McDermott test here!](https://github.com/sijiazhao/headphonecheck/blob/master/headphonesTest.html)

The detials of that task has been documented in [Woods KJP, Siegel MH, Traer J & McDermott JH (2017) Headphone screening to facilitate web-based auditory experiments. Attention, Perception & Psychophysics](http://mcdermottlab.mit.edu/papers/Woods_etal_2017_headphone_screening.pdf). And you can also find their version of implementation on [here](https://github.com/mcdermottLab/HeadphoneCheck).
